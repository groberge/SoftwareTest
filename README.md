How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

I can ensure that my code, program or software is functional and secure by using JUnit tests to confirm that each function or method works as expected.  By starting with the basic methods of setting the values of attributes, I test my program with the lowest level of functionality.  I can then test to ensure that any requirements are met by attempting to set the values with values that do not meet the requirements.  By trying to think of ways to use my program incorrectly, I can further strengthen my testing skills to catch as many bugs as possible prior to release.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

I interpret user needs by speaking with the user or project manager to get a better understanding of what is being requested.  By reviewing the information that I am given with the user, I can step through the process of their workflow to get more details on what is expected.  Once this is completed, I can then come up with a way to implement the functionality.  If there are multiple options that would be seen by the user, then I would go back to my notes from the review and find the best option that will meet their needs, keep the original functionality working correctly and not negatively affect any other aspects of the program.

How do I approach designing software?

I approach designing software by making sure that I have a good understanding of what the software is supposed to do.  Sometimes, what the developer thinks is needed or is a good feature isn't necessarily going to be useful or beneficial to the user.  Once I get a good understanding, then I start by finding the different options that can be used to program the project and work to find the best options to use.  One the program is analyzed and the options are figured out, then I can start breaking the larger product into much smaller areas which can then be broken into classes along with the functions and attributes that can be used to create the finished product.  At this point, I'm able to start the actual writing of the code to start creating the product.
